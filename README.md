## Introduction

This is a PowerBI project where the data is obtained from the Human Resource Manager of an Indian company. The fiscal year starts from April and ends in March. We will be combining three months of data to gain insights into individuals' work preferences.

## Problem statement
1.	Working preference of people between work from home or work from office.
2.	How many people are present in a given week or month?
3.	Find the sick leave percentage for April and June
   
## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:
The following Power BI features were incorporated:
-	Cleaning
-	Slicer
-	Function
-	Dax
-	Custom column
-	Measure
-	Managing Perimeters.
## Visualisation
It's a one-page dashboard. You can interact with the dashboard [here] (https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTI5NTE3ZTgtMDYxNy00ZTllLWEzYTEtNTI2NDMzNmZmYzg4IiwidCI6IjIyMTc3MTMwLTY0MmYtNDFkOS05MjExLTc0MjM3YWQ1Njg3ZCIsImMiOjN9)
# Analysis
- The percentage of people working from the office in April was 94.05%, 89.75%, and 91.82%, while the percentage of people working from home was 9.08%, 11.23%, and 9.44%.
- From the 24th of April to the 30th of April, 95.28% of employees were present for work, an increase from the initial 94.76% in the first week.
- In April, the company had 0.43% of employees taking sick leave, and in June, 1.18% of employees took sick leave.
## Recommendation: 
- Looking at the chart, it is evident that the majority of people prefer to work from home on Fridays. We can design a hybrid model that allows for working from home on Fridays for everyone.
- If we come to a decision to implement a hybrid model, where certain individuals are designated to work for a duration of three days, while others work for two days each week, we can introduce a rotational schedule to effectively and efficiently meet the weekly requirements and obligations.
